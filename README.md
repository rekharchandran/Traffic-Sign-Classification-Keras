# Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Learning in Python/Keras
Traffic signs(GTSRB) classification with a convolutional network (keras and python)
## Problem Statement and Goal of the Project
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
The problem is to to recognize the traffic sign from the images.

### Process

Similar to any machine learning model building process we will also be executing the same golden steps defined below
1) Understand the data                                                                                                                                                              
2)Preprocess the data                                                                                                                                                                    
3)Build the architecture of the model                                                                                                                                                     
4)Test the model                                                                                                                                                                     
5)Iterate the same process until you achieve the optimal results                                                                                                                       
6)Deploy the model (Not considered for this exercise)
